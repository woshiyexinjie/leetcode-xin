/**
 * Created by nandiexin on 2019/3/12.
 * Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Given a binary tree
 * 1
 * / \
 * 2   3
 * / \
 * 4   5
 * Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
 * <p>
 * Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
