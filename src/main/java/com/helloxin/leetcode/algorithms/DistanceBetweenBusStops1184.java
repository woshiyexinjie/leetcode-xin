 * A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.
 * <p>
 * The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.
 * <p>
 * Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.
