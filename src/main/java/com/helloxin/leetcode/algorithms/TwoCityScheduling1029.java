/**
 * Created by yexin on 2019/10/27.
 * There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].

 Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.



 Example 1:

 Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
 Output: 110
 Explanation:
 The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
 The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
 The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
 The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

 The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
